# ▉ 3d model prices (for reference) ▉  


NOTE: This pricing is for a model optimised for MMD ONLY and will be recieved in the .pmx file type. I do not currently provide files for use with VR and VSF, but you can use an external program to convert the format.

**streaming commercially price**

Modeling combo start at 800 USD
-face and body mesh
-rig and dynamic
-40 blendshapes
-full textures

Add-on:
+150 USD+ if you need a base as a seperate rig
+100 USD+ if you need hair
+500 USD+ if you need outfit (top,bottom,shoes)
+50 USD/each for additional props or parts
+20 USD/each if you need to make additional custom blendshapes

All prices are for reference only, depending on the complexity of the design.Most models will be 1600 USD+

-I will make a 3D model with more than 95% similarity to the Live 2D art you provided.
-I also accept outfit only commissions, but require a base from the client.
