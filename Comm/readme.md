# ▉ FAQ ▉ 

###  Can the commissioned model be used for NSFW?

◆ Sure, I can't make R18 content but it is feasible for R18 and NSFW.

###  can you make a head or base only?

◆ Sorry, I'm not accepting at the moment.

### For some reason I don't want to commission anymore, can I cancel it?

◆ Yes, but I will not return the deposit that already paid. To avoid this, please double check before you pay the deposit.

### When do I get feedback? is it possible for me to change anything?

◆ I will update as soon as the commission begins, usually once a week and more frequently as we get closer to delivery.

You can always tell me what needs to be replaced or changed before I start working on the part you want to change, otherwise I won't change it.

Before the rig phase, I can accept substantial modifications (I will inform you) After the rig, all major modifications will be additionally priced.

### I am a returning customer, can I customize new outfit?

◆ Sure, just provide me with an image or concept design of your new outfit and I can make it for you.
